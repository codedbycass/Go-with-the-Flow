## Overview

### What
Go with the Flow is a comprehensive full-stack application designed as a reproductive health tracker. It serves as a versatile tool for tracking menstrual cycles and overall sexual health and wellness. The app is functional both during and outside of the user's menstrual cycle. Users can log entries starting with the date, selecting their period status from options such as no period, period start, period end, and spotty to heavy flows. By recording daily data centered around their period start and end dates, users gain insights into their behavioral patterns throughout their cycle. The app prioritizes security, requiring user login to safeguard sensitive health information.
